If you do not you cannot be granted a Location NFT. This proves you're effectively contributing to our network.",
      "installationProcess": "Installing GEODNET is straightforward, with deployment with a clear line of sight being recommended, with a 10 degree angle with no obstructions. This ensures maximum satellite connectivity which is needed to lock your hex and earn the location NFT. Any negative factors will result in bad GNSS signal quality. Obstructions and interference from over-hanging trees will result in poor GNSS signal quality further. In the backend system, GEODNET monitors the GNSS signal quality and issue GEOD tokens based on the GNSS signal quality.",

      "howMuchCanYouEarn": "Wingbits is a cutting-edge project offering an exclusive early participation boost for new miners. Each Res 3 hexagon generates a daily pool of 29 $WINGS tokens, distributed among participants based on aircraft positional messages. Top performing miners can earn hundreds of $WING tokens with the average miner earning 29 tokens per day. Although $WINGS tokens are currently in TestNet and don’t yet have an official value, the MainNet launch is set for Q4 2024 on the Solana blockchain. Seize this opportunity to join a pioneering network at its early stages!",
      "installationProcess": "Installing Wingbits is simple and efficient. For the best results, we recommend deploying your hardware with a clear line of sight at a 10-degree angle, free from obstructions. This setup maximizes visibility to aircraft, allowing you to earn higher rewards. Any factors that negatively impact the line of sight—such as overhanging trees or other obstructions—will degrade the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) signal quality, reducing your potential earnings. The Wingbits backend system continuously monitors ADS-B signal quality and adjusts token rewards accordingly, ensuring that those with optimal setups are rewarded fairly.",

Shade above the device can distort data, while heating elements can affect miner temperature, leading to inaccurate readings. The network cross-verifies data with neighboring miners; significant discrepancies may alert the system. Additionally, confirm there are no more than 10 miners per hex in your area. Use our hex checker below to verify these conditions.",
      "installationProcess": "Installing WeatherXM is straightforward, with deployment away from buildings that could shade the device recommended. The device should be positioned at least 2 meters above ground level. You can choose between installing with a ground-level pole or a rooftop side mount, depending on your preference. When checking out on our website, select the mount that best suits your installation needs. The device connects directly to a Helium IoT miner. If unsure about the presence of an IoT miner nearby, check on Moken.",
